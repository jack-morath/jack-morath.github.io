				<p>My name is Jack and this is my great website. I participate in no sports, clubs, or activities. My hobbies include talking to my friends, doodling on my Intuos pro, and playing videogames. I play many different kinds of games but mostly Super Smash Bros. Melee and Rivals of Aether. I have no clue where I want to go to college but I know I want to do something related to computers, and more recently I have gained interest in becoming a storyboard artist.</p>
